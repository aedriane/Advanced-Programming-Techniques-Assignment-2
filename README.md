Advanced Programming Techniques Assignment 2 Semester 1 2017

This program is a simple phone book that holds an array of people with one or more phone numbers in memory. 

Each specific node holds information such as Identification, Name, and/or one or more phone numbers. Phone numbers aren't 
mandatory for a specific person but they still remain in the phone book.

Concepts utilised are pointers, arrays, doubly linked lists, tokenizer, handling and releasing of memory on a stack, nodes
with an array containing one or more elements, etc.

Before execution of this program, one must firstly use 'make' to utilise the MakeFile executable which contains dynamic 
compilation of all the .c and .h files in the directory. This creates the .o extension files. 

After 'make' has been successfully utilised, ./addressbook may be used to execute the program.
